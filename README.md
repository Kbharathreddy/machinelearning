This repository contains Python implementations of 9 distinct machine learning-related exercises completed in Jupyter Notebook format as part of Lab 2. Each problem demonstrates the application of foundational concepts such as matrix operations, gradient descent, linear regression, and more.
**lab2(ML).ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing solutions to all 9 problems.
The notebook includes solutions for the following:
1. **Matrix Operations** – Rank, dimensions, vector calculations.
2. **Cost Calculation** – Product cost estimation using matrices.
3. **Linear Regression** – Implemented from scratch and via libraries.
4. **Gradient Descent** – Loss minimization visualization.
5. **Hypothesis Representation** – Custom model functions.
6. **Data Preprocessing** – Handling missing data, normalization.
7. **Performance Metrics** – MSE, RMSE, R² calculations.
8. **Data Visualization** – Matplotlib and Seaborn for insights.
9. **Model Evaluation** – Training/test split, plotting predictions.
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries:
  ```bash
